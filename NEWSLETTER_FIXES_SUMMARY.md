# Newsletter System Improvements

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. Contact List Selection Not Prominent During Sending
**Problem**: When sending newsletters, users couldn't clearly see or change which contact list would receive the email.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the send modal with a prominent orange-highlighted section
- Added real-time recipient count estimation
- Allowed contact list changes right before sending
- Added "Send Test Email First" button for preview testing

### 2. Newsletter Builder Didn't Use Modern Design
**Problem**: The template builder used a basic gradient design instead of the beautiful soft geometric design from the reference image.

**Solution**:
- Completely replaced the template generator with soft geometric design
- Added abstract circles, lines, and shapes as background elements
- Implemented central hexagon with customizable accent color
- Used professional typography and modern spacing
- Added soft shadows and contemporary styling
