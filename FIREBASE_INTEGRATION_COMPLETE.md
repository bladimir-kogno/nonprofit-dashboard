```

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Get Firebase Service Account Key (Required for server operations)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nonprofit-dashboard27)
2. Project Settings → Service Accounts
3. Generate new private key
4. Replace the placeholder in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"nonprofit-dashboard27",...}
   ```

### 2. Set Up Firebase Authentication (Optional Upgrade)
To replace hardcoded auth with Firebase Auth:

1. Enable Authentication in Firebase Console
2. Set up Email/Password provider
3. Create admin user in Firebase Console
4. Update `app/layout.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   import FirebaseAuthGuard from '../components/auth/FirebaseAuthGuard';
   // Replace AuthGuard with FirebaseAuthGuard
   ```

### 3. Test Email Services
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test email sending through your app
# Both SendGrid and Gmail SMTP are configured
```

## 📧 Email Service Features

### Optimized Email System
- **Primary**: SendGrid API (faster, more reliable)
- **Fallback**: Gmail SMTP (backup when SendGrid fails)
- **Bulk sending**: Optimized for newsletters with rate limiting
- **Personalization**: Support for dynamic content

### Usage Examples
```typescript
import { emailService, sendWelcomeEmail } from '@/lib/email-service';

// Send welcome email
await sendWelcomeEmail('user@example.com', 'John Doe');

// Send custom email
await emailService.sendEmail({
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Thank you for your donation!',
  html: '<h1>Thank you!</h1><p>Your support means everything.</p>'
});

// Send newsletter to multiple recipients
await emailService.sendBulkEmail({
  recipients: [
    { email: 'user1@example.com', name: 'John' },
    { email: 'user2@example.com', name: 'Jane' }
  ],
  subject: 'Monthly Newsletter',
  html: newsletterContent
});
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- User profiles and admin settings

### Environment Security
```bash
# Secure environment variables (already configured)
✅ SENDGRID_API_KEY (secured)
